        <p>A true legend of the game, Nicol David is one of the most decorated sports stars of a generation and has broken a succession of remarkable records during her career to date - capturing the hearts of thousands of adoring fans in the process.</p>
        <p>The Penang-born superstar burst onto the scene when she won her first Women's World Junior Squash Championship in 1999 before claiming her maiden Tour title in February 2000 when she triumphed at the Savcor Finnish Open.
    Later that same year, David became the first female to lift the World Junior Championship for a second time, while 2002 saw her win a Commonwealth Games silver medal in the mixed doubles event.</p>
        <p>A couple of barren years soon followed but, after breaking into the World's top five in January 2005, she went on to notch up a record-breaking year.
    She not only became the first Malaysian to win the Malaysian Open Squash Championship and British Open, she then captured her first World Championship crown after defeating Rachael Grinham in the final to lift the sportâ€™s most coveted prize.</p>
        <p>January 2006 saw her become the first Asian women ever to reach the World No.1 spot but she lost top spot to Vanessa Atkinson three months later. David demonstrated her dominance in the latter stages of the season, romping to six Tour titles and reclaiming her World No.1 ranking in August, before defending her World Championship title in November where she defeated the younger Grinham sister, Natalie.</p>
        <p>David lost out in the final of the British Open in 2007 but a year later she swept all before her, winning ten Tour titles and going unbeaten throughout the year, capturing the British Open title and her third World Championship crown.
    David's 56-match unbeaten run came to an end in 2009 against Natalie Grainger, but the Malaysian continued her haul of titles, including capturing four more consecutive World Championship in as many years.</p>
        <p>In February 2015 the Malaysian celebrated her 106th consecutive month at the top of the World Rankings to overtake New Zealand's Susan Devoy as the longest-reigning World No.1, cementing her place as one of squash's greatest ever players.</p>
